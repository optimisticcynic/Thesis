%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The results of the \phistar measurement using only \xxbar{e}{e} data are shown in the following plots. The \xxbar{e}{e} is the sample that was combined with the \xxbar{\mu}{\mu} for the results shown in Sec. \ref{Sec:Blue}. Both the normalized and absolute 1D results are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Unfoldedee1DResults}, while the 2D results are all normalized.
